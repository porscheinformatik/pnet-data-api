    methods!

-   Updated dependencies.
-   Added an Rest Client adapter for the the Apache HTTP Client version 5.
-   Added a new paging option by using "searchAfter". Since we have switched to Elasticsearch 8 as our document store, the
    process of iterating over pages has been discouraged by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this has to be reflected in
    our client. Some properties in the result, like "pageIndex" and "numberOfPages", are not reliable anymore. You may add
    the system property "-Dpnet-data-api.avoid-search-after=true" to make sure, that the "nextPage" method is using the
    pageIndex to load the next page (as a consequence, the pageIndex property will be filled correctly - with your given
    value).

    older Spring Boot version (since the Data API does not depend on it, nor does is use any Jakarta packages). You still
    have to use up-to-date libraries like Jackson 2.14 or greater, Spring-Web 6.0 or greater (if using the Spring
    connector) and Java 17 or greater.
