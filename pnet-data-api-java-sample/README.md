# Partner.&#78;et Data API Java Client Sample

This project contains a sample for using the Java client for the Partner.&#78;et Data API.

# Building

You will need Git, Java >= 17 and Maven.

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/porscheinformatik/pnet-data-api.git
```

Next, perform a Maven build:

```
mvn install
```

That's it.

# Execute

The build will create various executables in the target directory. The sample is a console tool for accessing the Data API. Start it with `java -jar pnet-data-api-java-sample-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar` (don't forget to set the current version instead of the '\*').

The sample application will present you a console interface. Type `help` and press enter. It will show you all available commands.

First, set the URL and the user creditals. Use the `url` command for this:

```
> url https://qa-data.auto-partner.net/data
```

Next, set the token or the username/password:

```
> token <TOKEN>
```

or

```
> user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
```

You can aquire the <TOKEN> or the <USERNAME>/<PASSWORD> with the Partner.Net "Systemuser Selfservice" interface.

Use the `about` command to test the connection. It will perform a login on the first request and use the JSON-Web Token for all later ones.

```
> about
```

If the call fails, check the logs in the Partner.Net "Systemuser Selfservice". Maybe you IP is not permitted. If this is the case, add it to the list.

The `about`command will return some information about your user:

```
{
  "partnerNetVersion" : "6.41.9",
  "dataApiVersion" : "1",
  "userId" : xxx,
  "tenants" : [ "AT" ],
  "authorities" : [ "SWAGGER_API", "DATA_API" ]
}
```

If everything is ok, you can store the URL and the login credentials for later use in the registry:

```
> store <KEY>
```

You can list stored URLs with `list` and load one with `load <KEY>`.

Next try to search for functions. Type:

```
> search functions verkÃ¤ufer
```

It will print the first ten results. To navigate the pages, use `next` and `prev`.

To list all persons, that a visible to your user, try:

```
> export all persons
```

This will list all persons, that gave the consent to the application your system user is linked to.

Finally you can exit the application with `exit`.
